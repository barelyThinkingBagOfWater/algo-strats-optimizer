#NOTES
Marchés US ouvrent à 20h30 (check Finnhub stream)

What stocks to buy :
For high returns, choose stocks with high volatility, low liquidity, and low price. 
First, only buy stocks that have the potential to move fast. Secondly, choose the security with a small volume 
to stay away from high-frequency traders.

#Morning reversal
Most of the liquidity and trading activity in the market occurs in the morning and on the close.

In the morning stocks will trend hard for the first 20-30 minutes into the 10 am reversal time zone.  Day traders 
that are looking to go opposite to the trend can wait for a close at the high or low of the 5-minute bar
to go opposite to the morning move. L'article parlait des 5 minutes mais l'auteur avoue que 5 minutes est pas parfait.
Tu as les 1 minute :) Essaie avec ça. Apparently high success rate. Check dans les 2 sens. Et tu peux utiliser
only les quotes de la première heure du matin, 24x plus rapide :) 

Comme paramètres tu peux avoir les paliers/stop loss d'achat/vente.

The smart money will grab the breakout and ride the market for quick profits. However, new traders will either
 hold on too long or jump on the bandwagon too late. The problem with 5-minute charts is that the time frame 
 is too large to capture the volatility of the move heading into the 10 am reversal, hence the morning reversal.


#Price change
If the stock moves up 10% for two days and it took six days to decline by 5% to 6%, 
it is a strong sign of a divergence in the trend.

However, you need to backtest this strategy to see the behavior of a particular stock. 
You can’t use this method on all equities in the market.
